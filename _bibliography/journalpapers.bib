  abstract={The stabilization of quantum states is a fundamental problem for realizing various quantum technologies. 
  Measurement-based-feedback strategies have demonstrated powerful performance, and the construction of quantum control signals using measurement information has attracted great interest. 
  However, the interaction between quantum systems and the environment is inevitable, especially when measurements are introduced, which leads to decoherence. 
  To mitigate decoherence, it is desirable to stabilize quantum systems faster, thereby reducing the time of interaction with the environment. 
  In this paper, we utilize information obtained from measurement and apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, 
  without explicitly constructing specific complex measurement-control mappings, to rapidly drive random initial quantum state to the target state. 
  The proposed DRL algorithm has the ability to speed up the convergence to a target state, which shortens the interaction between quantum systems and their environments to protect coherence. 
  Simulations are performed on two-qubit and three-qubit systems, and the results show that our algorithm can successfully stabilize random initial quantum system to the target entangled state, 
  with a convergence time faster than traditional methods such as Lyapunov feedback control and several DRL algorithms with different reward functions. 
  Moreover, it exhibits robustness against imperfect measurements and delays in system evolution.}

Conditions on invariant and attractive subspaces are investigated, which ensure the stabilization of the target state/subspace. For a class of open quantum systems with time delay in the feedback loop, a bang-bang-like control law is proposed, and the stability of the feedback control strategy is proved. An example of four-level Markovian open quantum systems is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract={Quantum entanglement plays a fundamental role in quantum computation and quantum communication. Feedback control has been widely used in stochastic quantum systems to generate given entangled states since it has good robustness, where the time required to compute filter states and conduct filter-based control usually cannot be ignored in many practical applications. This paper designed two control strategies based on the Lyapunov method to prepare a class of entangled states for qubit systems with a constant delay time. The first one is bang–bang-like control strategy, which has a simple form with switching between a constant value and zero, the stability of which is proved. Another control strategy is switching Lyapunov control, where a constant delay time is introduced in the filter-based feedback control law to compensate for the computation time. Numerical results on a two-qubit system illustrate the effectiveness of these two proposed control strategies.},

  abstract={Robustness and reliability are two key requirements for developing practical quantum control systems. The purpose of this article is to design a coherent feedback controller for a class of linear quantum systems suffering from Markovian jumping faults so that the closed-loop quantum system has both fault tolerance and H∞ disturbance attenuation performance. This article first extends the physical realization conditions from the time-invariant case to the time-varying case for linear stochastic quantum systems. By relating the fault-tolerant H∞ control problem to the dissipation properties and the solutions of Riccati differential equations, an H∞ controller for the quantum system is then designed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. In particular, an algorithm is employed to introduce additional quantum inputs and to construct the corresponding input matrices to ensure the physical realizability of the quantum controller. Also, we propose a real application of the developed fault-tolerant control strategy to quantum optical systems. A linear quantum system example from quantum optics, where the amplitude of the pumping field randomly jumps among different values due to the fault processes, can be modeled as a linear Markovian jumping system. It is demonstrated that a quantum H∞ controller can be designed and implemented using some basic optical components to achieve the desired control goal for this class of systems.},

  abstract={Optical Parametric Oscillators (OPOs) have wide applications in quantum optics for generating squeezed states and developing advanced technologies. When the phase or/and the amplitude of the pumping field for an OPO have fluctuations due to fault signals, time-varying uncertainties will be introduced in the dynamic parameters of the system. In this paper, we investigate how to design a fault-tolerant  controller for an OPO with a disturbance input and time-varying uncertainties, which can achieve the required  performance of the quantum system. We apply robust  control theory to a quantum system, and design a passive controller and an active controller based on the solutions to two Riccati equations. The passive controller has a simple structure and is easy to be implemented by using only passive optical components, while the active quantum controller may achieve improved performance. The control performance of the proposed two controllers and one controller that was designed without consideration of system uncertainties is compared by numerical simulations in a specific OPO, and the results show that the designed controllers work effectively for fluctuations in both the phase and amplitude of the pumping field.},

  abstract={Self-sustained oscillators (SSOs) is a commonly used method to generate classical clock signals and SSOs using delayed feedback have been developed commercially which possess ultra-low phase noise and drift. Research into the development of quantum self-oscillation, where one can also have a periodic and regular output tick, that can be used to control quantum and classical devices has received much interest and quantum SSOs so far studied suffer from phase diffusion which leads to the smearing out of the quantum oscillator over the entire limit cycle in phase space seriously degrading the system’s ability to perform as a self-oscillation. In this paper, we explore quantum versions of time-delayed SSOs, which has the potentials to develop a ticking quantum clock. We first design a linear quantum SSO which exhibits perfect oscillation without phase diffusion. We then explore a nonlinear delayed quantum SSO but find it exhibits dephasing similar to previously studied non-delayed systems.},
