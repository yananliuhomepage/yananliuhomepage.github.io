  abstract={Self-sustained oscillators (SSOs) is a commonly used method to generate classical clock signals and SSOs using delayed feedback have been developed commercially which possess ultra-low phase noise and drift. Research into the development of quantum self-oscillation, where one can also have a periodic and regular output tick, that can be used to control quantum and classical devices has received much interest and quantum SSOs so far studied suffer from phase diffusion which leads to the smearing out of the quantum oscillator over the entire limit cycle in phase space seriously degrading the system’s ability to perform as a self-oscillation. In this paper, we explore quantum versions of time-delayed SSOs, which has the potentials to develop a ticking quantum clock. We first design a linear quantum SSO which exhibits perfect oscillation without phase diffusion. We then explore a nonlinear delayed quantum SSO but find it exhibits dephasing similar to previously studied non-delayed systems.},
