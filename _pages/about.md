Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor in North America) at the [School of Engineering, University of Newcastle](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/school/engineering), Australia. 

Prior to joining the University of Newcastle, I served as a Research Fellow at [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/centre-quantum-dynamics), working with [Prof. Howard Wiseman](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/18725-howard-wiseman), from 06/2022 to 02/2024. I held a Postdoctoral Scholar supervised by [Prof. Jason Twamley](https://groups.oist.jp/qmech/jason-twamley) at [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://groups.oist.jp/qmech) from 03/2021 to 05/2022. From 12/2020 to 02/2021, I was a Research Associate advised by [Prof. Daoyi Dong](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/dong-dx) at [University of New South Wales, Canberra](https://www.unsw.edu.au/canberra) (UNSW Canberra).

I completed my Ph.D. in Electronic Engineering at [UNSW Canberra](https://www.unsw.edu.au/canberra) in 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Daoyi Dong](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/dong-dx), [Dr Hidehiro Yonezawa](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/rqc/opt_qtm_ctrl_res/index.html#member) and [Prof. Ian Petersen](https://cecc.anu.edu.au/people/ian-petersen).

My research interests include the quantum feedback control, quantum optimal control and quantum noise mitigation.
