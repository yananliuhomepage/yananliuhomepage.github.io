Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I will be joining the [School of Engineering](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/school/engineering), [University of Newcastle](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/), Australia as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor in North America) in March 2024.

I'm a Research Fellow in [Centre for Quantum Dynamics](https://www.griffith.edu.au/centre-quantum-dynamics) in [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au).

I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering at [University of New South Wales Canberra](https://www.unsw.edu.au/canberra) (UNSW Canberra) in 2021, co-advised by [Daoyi Dong](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/dong-dx), [Hidehiro Yonezawa](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/rqc/opt_qtm_ctrl_res/index.html#member) and [Ian R. Petersen](https://cecc.anu.edu.au/people/ian-petersen). I was a postdoc researcher at [UNSW Canberra](https://www.unsw.edu.au/canberra) from late 2020 to early 2021. I then moved to [Quantum Machines Unit](https://groups.oist.jp/qmech) in [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.oist.jp/) (OIST) Japan, where I worked as a postdoc scholar from 2021 to 2022. 

My research interests include the quantum feedback control and quantum noise mitigation.
