Introducing Bell, our feline superstar and the first "member" of our lab (currently holding the title solo). Born on August 25, 2022, in Canberra, Australia. Bell is a charming Ragdoll cat.

This social butterfly loves mingling with humans and has a knack for being an expert bug and spider catcher around the house. Her daily highlight? Zooming around the backyard like a mini tornado, proving that work-life balance is crucial.

Bell is a connoisseur of milk, freeze-dried food, and canned goodies, with a particular penchant for devouring fresh durian.

Don't be surprised if you find Bell supervising academics or napping in a sunlit cornerï½ž
